Make sure you download file "#From credentials.properties file"
by Generating OAuth Token Credentials
The first step for acquiring a token is to generate OAuth credentials from developer.here.com.

The 'credentials.properties' file created from above contains two values of interest, the Access Key ID and the Access Key Secret. 


A 'credentials.properties' file looks like this.

here.user.id = HERE-USER_ID
here.client.id = YOUR_CLIENT_ID
here.access.key.id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
here.access.key.secret = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET
here.token.endpoint.url = https://account.api.here.com/oauth2/token
